 * Better buffer performance:
   * if storing the text on a buffer is unusable, use the buffer as a proxy to scintilla.
   * Lock the buffer, you fool!
   * use mmap - have to create tmp files for unnamed buffers, and do clever stuff when assigning to filenames
   * it seems like dots were pathological when used with the python lexer.
   * Take care to not fiddle with the buffer while it is colorized
   * [DONE - routing the SyncFromBuffer through wx.CallAfter fixes this]
     running chatty 3 times with 100000 chars segfaults - memory leak
     somewhere? 
 * look into http://wiki.wxpython.org/LongRunningTasks for processes
 * create a 'fundamental' STC with pluggable lexer
 * use multiple views (start with a split window with two STCs and blepoume)
 * More sophisticated buffer handling - synchronize 'actions' rather than text
 * [DONE] write the stdout to the console as well, for posterity
 * [DONE] use events rather than polling threads - editors subscribe to their buffers onchange events
 * [DONE] investigate prev/next buffer - each window should have its own index into the bufferlist - prev/next should take index arg
 * list of buffers in menu - NB new buffers should automatically appear there
 * create new windows (WindowManager.new)
 * kill buffers
