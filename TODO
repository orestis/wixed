 * Better buffer performance:
   * if storing the text on a buffer is unusable, use the buffer as a proxy to scintilla.
   * Lock the buffer, you fool!
   * use mmap - have to create tmp files for unnamed buffers, and do clever stuff when assigning to filenames
   * it seems like dots were pathological when used with the python lexer.
   * Take care to not fiddle with the buffer while it is colorized
   * running chatty 3 times with 100000 chars segfaults - memory leak somewhere?
 * create a 'fundamental' STC with pluggable lexer
 * use multiple views (start with a split window with two STCs and blepoume)
 * [DONE] write the stdout to the console as well, for posterity
